# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. This project is perfect for beginners learning Python or anyone who wants a lighthearted calculator experience! 😊

## Features ✨

- **Addition** ➕: Adds two numbers together.
- **Subtraction** ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** ✖️: Multiplies the two numbers.
- **Division** ➗: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero!).
- **User-friendly** 🎈: Takes input from the user and displays results in a clear format.

## How to Use 🚀

1. Clone the repository or download the `fun_calculator.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
3. Enter the two numbers when prompted.
4. Enjoy the results of the calculations! 🎉

## Example Usage 📝

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Notes ⚠️

- This calculator assumes the user will not attempt to divide by zero. If you do, Python will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- The calculator supports decimal numbers for more precise calculations.

## Contributing 🤝
